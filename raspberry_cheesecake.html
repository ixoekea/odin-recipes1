      <li>

        medium bowl. Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: combine raspberries, water, sugar, and cornstarch in a
        saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling until sauce is thick,
        about 5 minutes. Strain through a mess strainer to remove seeds. Preheat
        the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
      </li>
      <li>
        Make cheesecake: Melt white chocolate chips with half-and-half in a
        metal bowl over a pan of simmering water; stir occasionally until
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat
        in eggs one at a time. Blend in vanilla and melted white chocolate
        mixture. Pour 1/2 of the batter over crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Pour remaining
        cheesecake batter on top. Spoon 3 tablespoons of raspberry sauce over
        batter. Swirl batter with the tip of a knife to create a marbled effect.
      </li>
